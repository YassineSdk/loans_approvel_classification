    "in this project we are building a model to power the decision making of a financial organisarion called loanless , this organisation is a financial instution , specialized in micro financial loans , so in they risk management strategie they are asking us to build a model to help reduce the default risk , this model would take data related to the client financial  and social situation in order to assess his solvability and capacity of honoring his engagement , so as a datascient team we need to make a robust model based on historical data related to the loans default in order to help Loanless manage there financial risk .\n",
